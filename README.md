# 🚀 Evangelos Gakias – AI Engineer Portfolio

## 👋 Hello world, I’m Evan (Evangelos Gakias)!

**Ex-Civil/Structural Engineer turned AI Engineer** — self-taught, self-driven, and fully committed.  
In just 9 months, I transitioned into AI, earning **6 professional certifications** and developing **17+ AI/ML projects** — all solo, with zero prior experience in the field. Now, I’m building cutting-edge, production-ready applications with real-world impact.
